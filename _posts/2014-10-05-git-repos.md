Clients with certain hosting providers have the luxury of using git as a version control system.

Connecting to a server via SSH, anyone with access can manage a version controlled directory using their favorite git client. Below is a brief tutorial on how to setup a bare git repository on a linux server.

<hr>

Begin by tunneling into your server with SSH. Create a bare git repository using the code below. Be sure to replace <span class="text-warning">%reponame%</span> with the your desired repository name.

{% highlight sh %}
mkdir %reponame%.git && cd %reponame%.git
git --bare init
vi
{% endhighlight %}

Once in the vi editor, press the `i` key to insert the following code into a new file. Be sure to replace <span class="text-warning">%path/to/working/theme/or/plugin%</span> with the path to your desired working directory.

{% highlight sh %}
#!/bin/sh
GIT_WORK_TREE=~/%path/to/working/theme/or/plugin% git checkout -f
{% endhighlight %}

Hit the `[esc]` key to end editing of the file. Type `:w post-receive` to save the file. Press `:q` to quit the vi editor.

Insert the following code into the terminal window. Be sure to replace <span class="text-warning">%path/to/working/theme/or/plugin%</span> with the path to your desired working directory.

{% highlight sh %}
chmod +x post-receive
mkdir ~/%path/to/working/theme/or/plugin%
{% endhighlight %}
