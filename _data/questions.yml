- question: "Why do we need more money for transportation? Are current funds being misspent?"
  answer: "The reality is that Hillsborough County has just been growing very quickly! Even making the most economical decisions possible, we are unable to stretch current funds far enough to cover the large backlog of transportation needs. Knowing that future population growth is projected to increase even faster, it is clear that the time to act is now."

- question: "Are we just picking up the tab for undertaxed developers?"
  answer: "While there was a period where developers were not paying enough taxes on new developments (which has been rectified), that is not the catalyst behind our transportation needs. The biggest driver is population growth."

- question: "Where can I see what projects are being considered for the future?"
  answer: "There are many useful (though occasionally dense) <a href=\"http://gohillsborough.org/useful-documents\" target=\"_blank\">documents on planned projects</a> at GoHillsborough’s website."

- question: "How can I voice my opinion on our transportation future?"
  answer: "Come out to a GoHillsborough meeting! We want to hear your opinions. (It’s why we’ve held over 50 public meetings so far, with more to come.) <a href=\"http://gohillsborough.org/category/meetings\" target=\"_blank\">Find an upcoming meeting</a>."
