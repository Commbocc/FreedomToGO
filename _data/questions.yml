- question: "Why do we need more money for transportation? Are current funds being misspent?"
  answer: "Hillsborough County has been growing very quickly! Even making economical  funding decisions, we are unable to stretch the budget far enough to cover current transportation needs."

- question: "Are we just picking up the tab for undertaxed developers?"
  answer: "Closing a loophole that did not collect enough taxes from developers has been a positive step, but it is not sufficient to solve our transportation issues."

- question: "Where can I see what projects are being considered for the future?"
  answer: "There are many useful (though occasionally dense) <a href=\"http://gohillsborough.org/useful-documents\" target=\"_blank\">documents on planned projects</a> at GoHillsborough’s website."

- question: "How can I voice my opinion on our transportation future?"
